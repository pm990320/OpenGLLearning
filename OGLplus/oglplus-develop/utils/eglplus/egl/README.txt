This directory contains an implementation of the EGL v.1.4 API, based on X11/GLX.
Note however, that the implementation is incomplete and not completely conforming
to the EGL specification, and should NOT be considered an official or production-
ready EGL implementation and should not be distributed without this notice.
It is used internally for development/testing of EGLplus and is subject to change
without any prior notice.

Some of the source files in this directory are based on source or header files
from the Khronos Group Inc.
