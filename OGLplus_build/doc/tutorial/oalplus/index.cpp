/** @page oalplus_tutorials Tutorials
 *
 *  This section contains tutorials explaining step-by-step the usage of @OALplus.
 *  These tutorials are based on the examples that come with @OALplus.
 *
 *  Generally the tutorials assume that the reader has some programming
 *  skills and experience with C++. The first tutorials also try to explain
 *  how audio rendering with OpenAL works, what the individual resources like
 *  buffers, sources, etc. are used for in an OpenAL application, but the more
 *  advanced tutorials expect that the reader is acquainted with the basic concepts
 *  and the usage of OpenAL, which were explained in the earlier tutorials.
